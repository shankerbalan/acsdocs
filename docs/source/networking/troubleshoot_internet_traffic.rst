Troubleshooting Internet Internet Traffic
=========================================

Below are a few troubleshooting steps to check whats going wrong with your
network...

Trouble Shooting Steps
----------------------

#. The switches have to be configured correctly to pass VLAN traffic. You can
   verify if VLAN traffic is working by bringing up a tagged interface on the
   hosts and pinging between them as below...

   On *host1 (kvm1)*

   ::

     kvm1 ~$ vconfig add eth0 64
     kvm1 ~$ ifconfig eth0.64 1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
     kvm1 ~$ ping 1.2.3.5

   On *host2 (kvm2)*

   ::

     kvm2 ~$ vconfig add eth0 64
     kvm2 ~$ ifconfig eth0.64 1.2.3.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
     kvm2 ~$ ping 1.2.3.4

   If the pings dont work, run *tcpdump(8)* all over the place to check
   who is gobbling up the packets. Ultimately, if the switches are not
   configured correctly, CloudStack networking wont work so fix the
   physical networking issues before you proceed to the next steps

#. Ensure `Traffic Labels <http://cloudstack.apache.org/docs/en-US/Apache_CloudStack/4.2.0/html/Installation_Guide/about-physical-networks.html>`_ are set for the Zone.

   Traffic labels need to be set for all hypervisors including
   XenServer, KVM and VMware types. You can configure traffic labels when
   you creating a new zone from the *Add Zone Wizard*.

   On an existing zone, you can modify the traffic labels by going to
   *Infrastructure, Zones, Physical Network* tab.

   List labels using *CloudMonkey* 

   ::

     acs-manager ~$ cloudmonkey list traffictypes physicalnetworkid=41cb7ff6-8eb2-4630-b577-1da25e0e1145
     count = 4
     traffictype:
     id = cd0915fe-a660-4a82-9df7-34aebf90003e
     kvmnetworklabel = cloudbr0
     physicalnetworkid = 41cb7ff6-8eb2-4630-b577-1da25e0e1145
     traffictype = Guest
     xennetworklabel = MGMT
     ========================================================
     id = f5524b8f-6605-41e4-a982-81a356b2a196
     kvmnetworklabel = cloudbr0
     physicalnetworkid = 41cb7ff6-8eb2-4630-b577-1da25e0e1145
     traffictype = Management
     xennetworklabel = MGMT
     ========================================================
     id = 266bad0e-7b68-4242-b3ad-f59739346cfd
     kvmnetworklabel = cloudbr0
     physicalnetworkid = 41cb7ff6-8eb2-4630-b577-1da25e0e1145
     traffictype = Public
     xennetworklabel = MGMT
     ========================================================
     id = a2baad4f-7ce7-45a8-9caf-a0b9240adf04
     kvmnetworklabel = cloudbr0
     physicalnetworkid = 41cb7ff6-8eb2-4630-b577-1da25e0e1145
     traffictype = Storage
     xennetworklabel = MGMT
     =========================================================
  
#. KVM traffic labels require to be named as *"cloudbr0"*, *"cloudbr2"*,
   *"cloudbrN"* etc and the corresponding bridge must exist on the KVM
   hosts. If you create labels/bridges with any other names, CloudStack
   (atleast earlier versions did) seems to ignore them. CloudStack does not
   create the physical bridges on the KVM hosts, you need to create them
   **before** before adding the host to Cloudstack.

   ::

    kvm1 ~$ ifconfig cloudbr0
    cloudbr0  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:EF:7D:78  
          inet addr:192.168.44.22  Bcast:192.168.44.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::20c:29ff:feef:7d78/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:92435 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:50596 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
          RX bytes:94985932 (90.5 MiB)  TX bytes:61635793 (58.7 MiB)

#. The Virtual Router, SSVM, CPVM *public* interface would be bridged to
   a physical interface on the host. In the example below, *cloudbr0* is
   the public interface and CloudStack has correctly created the virtual
   interfaces bridge. This virtual interface to physical interface mapping
   is done automatically by CloudStack using the traffic label settings for
   the Zone. If you have provided correct settings and still dont have a
   working working Internet, check the switching layer before you debug any
   further. You can verify traffic using tcpdump on the virtual, physical
   and bridge interfaces.

   ::

     kvm-host1 ~$ brctl show
     bridge name  bridge id           STP enabled interfaces
     breth0-64    8000.000c29ef7d78   no          eth0.64

                                                  vnet3
     virbr0       8000.5254008e321a   yes         virbr0-nic

   ::

     xenserver1 ~$ brctl show
     bridge name  bridge id           STP enabled interfaces
     xapi0    0000.e2b76d0a1149       no          vif1.0
     xenbr0   0000.000c299b54dc       no          eth0
                                                  xapi1
                                                  vif1.1
                                                  vif1.2

#. Pre-create labels on the XenServer Hosts. Similar to KVM bridge
   setup, traffic labels must also be pre-created on the XenServer hosts
   before adding them to CloudStack.

   ::

     xenserver1 ~$ xe network-list 
     uuid ( RO)                : aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd
               name-label ( RW): MGMT
         name-description ( RW): 
                   bridge ( RO): xenbr0


#. The Internet would be accessible from both the SSVM and CPVM
   instances by default. Their public IPs will also be directly pingable
   from the Internet. Please note that these test would work only if your
   switches and traffic labels are configured correctly for your
   environment. If your SSVM/CPVM cant reach the Internet, its very
   unlikely that the Virtual Router (VR) can also the reach the Internet
   suggesting that its either a switching issue or incorrectly assigned
   traffic labels. Fix the SSVM/CPVM issues before you debug VR issues.

#. The Virtual Router (VR) should also be able to reach the Internet
   without having any Egress rules. The Egress rules only control forwarded
   traffic and not traffic that originates on the VR itself.

     PING google.com (74.125.236.164): 56 data bytes

#. However, the Virtual Router's (VR) Source NAT Public IP address
   **WONT** be reachable until appropriate Ingress rules are
   in place. You can add *Ingress* rules under *Network, Guest Network, IP
   Address, Firewall* setting page.

   .. image:: images/networking-ingress-rule.png

#. The VM Instances by default wont be able to access the Internet. Add
   Egress rules to permit traffic.

   .. image:: images/networking-egress-rule.png

#. Some users have reported that flushing IPTables rules (or changing
   routes) on the SSVM, CPVM or the Virtual Router makes the Internet work.
   This is not expected behaviour and suggests that your networking
   settings are incorrect. No IPtables/route changes are required on the
   SSVM, CPVM or the VR. Go back and double check all your settings.


In a vast majority of the cases, the problem has turned out to be at the
switching layer where the L3 switches were configured incorrectly.
